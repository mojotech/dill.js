Dill.Widget
===========

Widget is the base class upon which your custom widgets should extend from. The Widget class provides you with several helpful utility methods that interact with your DOM in an asynchronous promised based manner.

A simple example of an extension would look like this.

```js
MarketFilters = Widget.extend({
  root: '.market-place-filters',
  setSearchText: function(val) {
    return this.fill(".market-text-search", val);
  }
});
```

All Dill Widgets extend from seleniums [WebElement](http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/class_webdriver_WebElement.html)

# API

## Constructing

There are several ways to create a new `Widget` depending on your needs.

### Finding

In most cases the find based factory is going to suite your needs.

`Find` returns a promise based interface that eventually resolves to a widget with the `el` property already set to a [WebElement](http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/javascript/class_webdriver_WebElement.html) instance, it takes a hash of attributes as its argument that will be extending onto your object.

```js
Widget.find({
  root: "#big-papa"
}).then(function(widget) {
  // widget.el
  // is the raw WebElement node already found
  // for your convinence.
});
```

### Extending

Extending is simple way to create a new `Class` based on the base `Widget` class via the `.extend` syntax. Extend will override any method or value set on the base `Widget` object.

Using the extend functionality is a handy way to abstract widget configuration across multiple files and multiple methods into multiple reusable widgets.

```js
MyWidget = Widget.extend({
  root: ".biggie-biggie"
});

// Creating a new instance via new
myWidget = new MyWidget({optional: args});

// Creating a new instance via the find factory
MyWidget.find({optional: args}).then(function(widget) {
  myWidget = widget;
});
```

### Overriding

In any `Widgets` contructor you can override the default attributes set on said widget.

This is a handy paradigm to embrance when you have small one off widgets that do not need custom logic but rather just a few small helper methods and or properties.

```js
// Creating a new instance with overrides
myWidget = new Widget({optional: args});

// Creating a new instance via the find factory with overrides
Widget.find({optional: args}).then(function(widget) {
  myWidget = widget;
});
```

## Root

`root` must be provided in your widget class definition. It scopes all of a widgets DOM lookups to this root element.

The widget's required `root` property allows you to provide a scope on the page with which you are interacting. All operations for your widget will happen within the scope of the element.
It is a common pattern to have multiple widgets represent different parts of the page you are testing (e.g. the login div, the nav div, the form). This allows your widgets to be very focused and succinct.

```js
var PuppySearch = Widget.extend({
  root: '.dog-search',
});
```

## Interacting with the DOM

### Click

`function click(<cssSelector>)...`

`click` simulates a user clicking on the DOM selector that is passed in as a parameter to the function. It returns a promise to let you know when the click has been successful or rejected.

```js
var PuppySearch = Widget.extend({
  root: '.dog-search',
  clickOnTheDog: function() {
    return this.click(".dog");
  }
});
```

### Fill

`function fill(<cssSelector>, <valueToFillWith>)...`

`fill` allows you you to simulate a user filling in an input with a given value. It returns a promise to let you know when the fill has been successful or rejected.

```js
var PuppyNamer = Widget.extend({
  root: '.dog-namer',
  nameDog: function(name) {
    return this.fill(".dog-name", name);
  }
});
```

## Querying the DOM

## Read

`function read(<cssSelector>)...`

`read` allows you to get the "value" attribute or text of a given DOM node. It returns a promise with the result of the read or rejection.

```js
var PuppyDetails = Widget.extend({
  root: '.puppy-details',
  getName: function(name) {
    return this.read(".dog-name");
  }
});
```

## Find

`function find(<cssSelector>)...`

`find` allows you to find a (single) matching element on the page and grab the resulting DOM node. If a node is not found it will reject the returned promise value, otherwise the promise is resolved with the DOM node.

```js
var PuppyDetails = Widget.extend({
  root: '.puppy-details',
  getInfo: function(name) {
    return this.find(".dog-info");
  }
});
```

## FindAll

`function findAll(<cssSelector>)...`

`findAll` allows you to find a list of matching elements on a page and get an array of the matched DOM nodes. If no elements are found the promise is rejected, otherwise it is resolved with an array of nodes.

```js
var PuppyDetails = Widget.extend({
  root: '.puppy-details',
  getInfoItems: function(name) {
    return this.find(".dog-info li");
  }
});
```

## isPresent

`function isPresent()...`

`isPresent` is a utility method to check to see if a given widgets `root` is present on the page.
If the root is found then the promise is successfully resolved with true, otherwise it is resolved with false.
